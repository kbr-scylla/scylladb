/// Specific semaphore for controlling reader concurrency
///
/// Use `make_permit()` to create a permit to track the resource consumption
/// of a specific read. The permit should be created before the read is even
/// started so it is available to track resource consumption from the start.
/// Reader concurrency is dual limited by count and memory.
/// The semaphore can be configured with the desired limits on
/// construction. New readers will only be admitted when there is both
/// enough count and memory units available. Readers are admitted in
/// FIFO order.
/// Semaphore's `name` must be provided in ctor and its only purpose is
/// to increase readability of exceptions: both timeout exceptions and
/// queue overflow exceptions (read below) include this `name` in messages.
/// It's also possible to specify the maximum allowed number of waiting
/// readers by the `max_queue_length` constructor parameter. When the
/// number of waiting readers becomes equal or greater than
/// `max_queue_length` (upon calling `obtain_permit()`) an exception of
/// type `std::runtime_error` is thrown. Optionally, some additional
/// code can be executed just before throwing (`prethrow_action` 
/// constructor parameter).
///
/// The semaphore also acts as an execution stage for reads. This
/// functionality is exposed via \ref with_permit() and \ref
/// with_ready_permit().
