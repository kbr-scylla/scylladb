# As discovered in issue #10081, if the row determined by WHERE does NOT
# exist, Scylla still needs to read the static column, but forgets to do so.
# this test reproduces this issue.

# The fact that to reproduce #10081 above we needed the condition (IF) to
# mention a non-static column as well, suggests that Scylla has a different code
# path for the case that the condition has *only* static columns. In fact,
# in that case, the WHERE doesn't even need to specify the clustering key -
# the partition key should be enough. The following test confirms that this
# is indeed the case.

    # to a clustering column, i.e., mention the clustering key. If the
    # clustering key is missing, we get an InvalidRequest error, where the
    # message is slightly different between Scylla and Cassandra ("Missing
    # mandatory PRIMARY KEY part c" and "Some clustering keys are missing: c",
    # respectively.
