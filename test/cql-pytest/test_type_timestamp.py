# That latter concept is tested in test_timestamp.py, not here.

# According to the Cassandra documentation, a timestamp is a 64-bit integer
# "representing a number of milliseconds since the standard base time known
# as the epoch". This underlying "number" can be stored into a timestamp
# column by writing an integer directly to it, and later the number can be
# extracted during select with the built-in tounixtimestamp() function.
#
# In issue #11588, a user who mistakenly used a microsecond count reported
# that the write was successful, but then the read failed reporting that
# "timestamp is out of range. Must be in milliseconds since epoch".
# This is wrong and unhelpful beahvior, and the following test reproduces
# it. Cassandra currently allows the out-of-range number to be both written
# and then read - so that is the Cassandra-compatible approach - but
# arguably a more correct and useful behavior would be to fail the write
# up-front, even before reaching the read.

    # to write it. Scylla may decide in the future to fail this write (in
    # which case this test should be changed to accept both options, or
    # be marked scylla_only), but passing the write and failing the read
    # (as in #11588) is a bug.
