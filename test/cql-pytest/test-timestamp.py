# also had tests for timestamps, which we ported in
# cassandra_tests/validation/entities/json_timestamp.py. The tests here are
# either additional ones, or focusing on more esoteric issues or small tests
# aiming to reproduce bugs discovered by bigger Cassandra tests.

# current time in microseconds plus three days. Still, any negative is
# timestamp is still allowed in Scylla. If we ever choose to expand #5619
