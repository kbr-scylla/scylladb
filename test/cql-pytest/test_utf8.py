# letter 単 - it can be represented by a single Unicode character 00F1, but
# can also be represented as a 006E (lowercase "n") followed by a 0303
# ("combining tilde"). But if you write one of these representations, and
# then look up the other, Scylla will not find the item. So Scylla does
# not support unicode equivalence.
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence for more information
