# Tests for the SELECT requests with various restriction (WHERE) expressions.
# We have a separate test file test_filtering.py, for tests that focus on
# post-read filtering, so the tests in this file focus on restrictions that
# determine what to read. As in the future more sophisticated query planning
# techniques may mix up pre-read and post-read filtering, perhaps in the future
# we should just merge these two test files.

# Cassandra does not allow a WHERE clause restricting the same column with
# an equality more than once. It complains that that column "cannot be
# restricted by more than one relation if it includes an Equal".
# Scylla *does* allow this, but we want to check in this test that it works
# correctly - "WHERE a = 1 AND a = 2" should return nothing, and "WHERE
# a = 1 AND a = 1" should return the same as just "WHERE a = 1".
# Because these expressions are not allowed in Cassandra, this is a
# scylla_only test.
