# Tests for the SELECT requests with various filtering expressions.
# We have a separate test file test_allow_filtering.py, for tests that
# focus on whether the string "ALLOW FILTERING" is needed or not needed
# for a query. In the tests in this file we focus more on the correctness
# of various filtering expressions - regardless of whether ALLOW FILTERING
# is or isn't necessary.

# Reproducers for issue #8203, which test a scan (whole-table or single-
# partition) with filtering which keeps just the last row, after a long list
# of non-matching rows.
# As usual, the scan is done with paging, and since most rows do not match
# the filter, several empty pages should be returned until finally we get
# the expected matching row. If we allow the Python driver to iterate over
# all results, it should read all these pages and give us the one result.
# The bug is that the iteration stops prematurely (it seems after the second
# empty page) and an empty result set is returned.
