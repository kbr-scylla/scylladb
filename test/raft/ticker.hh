// Given a set of functions and associated positive natural numbers,
// calls the functions with periods defined by their corresponding numbers,
// yielding in between.
//
// Define a "tick" to be a (possibly empty) set of calls to some of the given functions
// followed by a yield. The ticker executes a sequence of ticks. Given {n, f}, where n
// is a number and f is a function, f will be called each nth tick.
//
// For example, suppose the ticker was started with the set {{2, f}, {4, g}, {4, h}}.
// Then the functions called in each tick are:
// tick 1: f, g, h tick 2: none, tick 3: f, tick 4: none, tick 5: f, g, h tick 2: none, and so on.
//
// The order of calls within a single tick is unspecified.
//
// The number of ticks can be limited. We crash if the ticker reaches the limit before it's `abort()`ed.
//
// Call `start` to provide the distribution and start the ticking.
