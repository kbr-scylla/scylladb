This alternative installation upgrade method allows you to upgrade your ScyllaDB version and update the 3rd party and OS packages using one command. This method is recommended if you run a ScyllaDB official image (EC2 AMI, GCP, and Azure images) based on Ubuntu 20.04.

#. Update the |SCYLLA_REPO|_ to |NEW_VERSION|.

#. Run the following command:
    
    .. code:: sh 
    
       cat scylla-packages-xxx-x86_64.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get -y
    
    
    Where xxx is the relevant Scylla version ( |NEW_VERSION| ). The file is included in the Scylla packages downloaded in the previous step.
    
    For example
    
        .. code:: sh 
           
           cat scylla-packages-5.1.2-x86_64.txt | sudo xargs -n1 apt-get -y
