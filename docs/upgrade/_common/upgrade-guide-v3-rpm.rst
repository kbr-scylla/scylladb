Upgrade Guide - |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION| for |OS|
=============================================================================================================

This document is a step by step procedure for upgrading from |SCYLLA_NAME| |SRC_VERSION| to |SCYLLA_NAME| |NEW_VERSION|, and rollback to |SRC_VERSION| if required.


Applicable versions
===================
This guide covers upgrading Scylla from the following versions: |SRC_VERSION|.x or later to |SCYLLA_NAME| version |NEW_VERSION|.y, on the following platforms:

* |OS|

Upgrade Procedure
=================

.. include:: /upgrade/_common/warning.rst

Upgrading your Scylla version is a rolling procedure that does not require a full cluster shutdown. For each of the nodes in the cluster, serially (i.e. one at a time), you will:

* Check the cluster's schema
* Drain the node and backup the data
* Backup the configuration file
* Stop the Scylla service
* Download and install new Scylla packages
* Start the Scylla service
* Validate that the upgrade was successful

Apply the following procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating the node is up and running with the new version.

**During** the rolling upgrade, it is highly recommended:

* Not to use new |NEW_VERSION| features
* Not to run administration functions, like repairs, refresh, rebuild or add or remove nodes. See `sctool <https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/sctool/index.html>`_ for suspending Scylla Manager (only available Scylla Enterprise) scheduled or running repairs.
* Not to apply schema changes

.. note:: Before upgrading, make sure to use |SCYLLA_MONITOR|_ or newer, for the Dashboards.

Upgrade steps
=============
Check the cluster schema
------------------------
Make sure that all nodes have the schema synched prior to upgrade as any schema disagreement between the nodes causes the upgrade to fail.

.. code:: sh

       nodetool describecluster

Drain node and backup the data
------------------------------
Before any major procedure, like an upgrade, it is **highly recommended** to backup all the data to an external device. In Scylla, backup is done using the ``nodetool snapshot`` command. For **each** node in the cluster, run the following command:

.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
   nodetool snapshot

Take note of the directory name that nodetool gives you, and copy all the directories having this name under ``/var/lib/scylla`` to an external backup device.

When the upgrade is complete (for all nodes), remove the snapshot by running ``nodetool clearsnapshot -t <snapshot>``, or you risk running out of disk space.

Backup configuration file
-------------------------
.. code:: sh

   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src

Stop Scylla
-----------
.. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-stop-index.rst


Download and install the new release
------------------------------------
Before upgrading, check what Scylla version you are currently running with ``rpm -qa | grep scylla-server``. You should use the same version as this version in case you want to :ref:`rollback <rollback-procedure>` the upgrade. If you are not running a |SRC_VERSION|.x version, stop right here! This guide only covers |SRC_VERSION|.x to |NEW_VERSION|.y upgrades.

To upgrade:

1. Update the |SCYLLA_REPO|_  to |NEW_VERSION|
2. Install the new Scylla version

.. code:: sh

   sudo yum clean all
   sudo yum update scylla\* -y

.. note::

   Alternator users upgrading from Scylla 4.0 to 4.1, need to set :doc:`default isolation level </upgrade/upgrade-opensource/upgrade-guide-from-4.0-to-4.1/alternator>`


Start the node
--------------
   .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-start-index.rst


Validate
--------
1. Check cluster status with ``nodetool status`` and make sure **all** nodes, including the one you just upgraded, are in UN status.
2. Use ``curl -X GET "http://localhost:10000/storage_service/scylla_release_version"`` to check the Scylla version. Validate that the version matches the one you upgraded to. 
3. Use ``journalctl _COMM=scylla`` to check there are no new errors in the log.
4. Check again after two minutes, to validate no new issues are introduced.

Once you are sure the node upgrade was successful, move to the next node in the cluster.

Rollback Procedure
==================

.. include:: /upgrade/_common/warning_rollback.rst

The following procedure describes a rollback from |SCYLLA_NAME| release |NEW_VERSION|.x to |SRC_VERSION|.y. Apply this procedure if an upgrade from |SRC_VERSION| to |NEW_VERSION| failed before completing on all nodes. Use this procedure only for the nodes that you upgraded to |NEW_VERSION|


Scylla rollback is a rolling procedure that does **not** require a full cluster shutdown.
For each of the nodes rollback to |SRC_VERSION|, you will:

* Drain the node and stop Scylla
* Retrieve the old Scylla packages
* Restore the configuration file
* Reload the systemd configuration
* Restart the Scylla service
* Validate the rollback success

Apply the following procedure **serially** on each node. Do not move to the next node before validating the rollback was successful and that the node is up and running with the old version.

Rollback steps
==============
Gracefully shutdown Scylla
--------------------------
.. code:: sh

   nodetool drain
 .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-stop-index.rst

Download and install the new release
------------------------------------
1. Remove the old repo file.

.. code:: sh

   sudo rm -rf /etc/yum.repos.d/scylla.repo

2. Update the |SCYLLA_REPO|_  to |SRC_VERSION|
3. Install

.. parsed-literal::
   \    sudo yum clean all
   \    sudo rm -rf /var/cache/yum
   \    sudo yum remove scylla\\*tools-core
   \    sudo yum downgrade scylla\\* -y
   \    sudo yum install |PKG_NAME|
   \    

Restore the configuration file
------------------------------

.. code:: sh

   sudo rm -rf /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml
   sudo cp -a /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml.backup-src| /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml

Restore system tables
---------------------

Restore all tables of **system** and **system_schema** from previous snapshot, |NEW_VERSION| uses a different set of system tables. Reference doc: :doc:`Restore from a Backup and Incremental Backup </operating-scylla/procedures/backup-restore/restore/>`

.. code:: sh

    cd /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/snapshots/<snapshot_name>/
    sudo cp -r * /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/
    sudo chown -R scylla:scylla /var/lib/scylla/data/keyspace_name/table_name-UUID/

Reload systemd configuration
---------------------------------

Require to reload the unit file if the systemd unit file is changed.

.. code:: sh

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the node
--------------


   .. include:: /rst_include/scylla-commands-start-index.rst

Validate
--------
Check the upgrade instruction above for validation. Once you are sure the node rollback is successful, move to the next node in the cluster. Keep in mind that the version you want to see on your node is the old version, which you noted at the beginning of the procedure.
