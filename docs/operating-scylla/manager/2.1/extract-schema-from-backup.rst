Extract schema from the backup

.. versionadded:: 2.1 Scylla Manager

The first step to restoring a Scylla Manager backup is to restore the CQL schema from a text file.
Scylla Manager version 2.1 creates a backup up of matching schema along with the snapshot.
If you created the backup with Scylla Manager version 2.0 or you didn't provide credentials for a schema backup in Scylla Manager version 2.1, follow the instructions in `how to restore your schema from system table <../../2.0/extract-schema-from-system-table/>`_.

If not, follow these steps to restore the schema from the Scylla Manager backup that has the schema stored along with the snapshot:

**Procedure**

#. List available backups:

   .. code-block:: none

      sctool backup list --cluster my-cluster --location s3:backup-bucket

#. List files located in snapshot you want to restore. The first line contains a path to the schema so pipe it to ``aws s3 cp`` for download it to the current directory. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      sctool backup files --cluster my-cluster -L s3:backup-bucket -T sm_20200513104924UTC --with-version | head -n 1 | xargs -n2 aws s3 cp
      download: s3://backup-bucket/backup/schema/cluster/7313fda0-6ebd-4513-8af0-67ac8e30077b/task_001ce624-9ac2-4076-a502-ec99d01effe4_tag_sm_20200513104924UTC_schema.tar.gz to ./task_001ce624-9ac2-4076-a502-ec99d01effe4_tag_sm_20200513104924UTC_schema.tar.gz


#. Create a directory to store the schema files and extract the archive containing the schema.

   .. code-block:: none

      mkdir ./schema
      tar -xf task_001ce624-9ac2-4076-a502-ec99d01effe4_tag_sm_20200513104924UTC_schema.tar.gz -C ./schema
      ls ./schema
      system_auth.cql  system_distributed.cql  system_schema.cql  system_traces.cql  user_data.cql

Listed files are schema files for each keyspace in the backup. You can use each cql file to restore needed keyspace and continue the :ref:`restore procedure <restore-backup-restore-schema>`
