/*
 * This struct is used in two incompatible ways.
 *
 * SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT cluster feature determines which way is
 * used.
 *
 * 1. If SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT is not enabled on the cluster then
 *    `page_size` field is ignored. Depending on the query type the meaning of
 *    the remaining two fields is:
 *
 *    a. For unpaged queries or for reverse queries:
 *
 *          * `soft_limit` is used to warn about queries that result exceeds
 *            this limit. If the limit is exceeded, a warning will be written to
 *            the log.
 *
 *          * `hard_limit` is used to terminate a query which result exceeds
 *            this limit. If the limit is exceeded, the operation will end with
 *            an exception.
 *
 *    b. For all other queries, `soft_limit` == `hard_limit` and their value is
 *       really a page_size in bytes. If the page is not previously cut by the
 *       page row limit then reaching the size of `soft_limit`/`hard_limit`
 *       bytes will cause a page to be finished.
 *
 * 2. If SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT is enabled on the cluster then all
 *    three fields are always set. They are used in different places:
 *
 *    a. `soft_limit` and `hard_limit` are used for unpaged queries and in a
 *       reversing reader used for reading KA/LA sstables. Their meaning is the
 *       same as in (1.a) above.
 *
 *    b. all other queries use `page_size` field only and the meaning of the
 *       field is the same ase in (1.b) above.
 *
 * Two interpretations of the `max_result_size` struct are not compatible so we
 * need to take care of handling a mixed clusters.
 *
 * As long as SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT cluster feature is not
 * supported by all nodes in the clustser, new nodes will always use the
 * interpretation described in the point (1). `soft_limit` and `hard_limit`
 * fields will be set appropriately to the query type and `page_size` field
 * will be set to 0. Old nodes will ignare `page_size` anyways and new nodes
 * will know to ignore it as well when it's set to 0. Old nodes will never set
 * `page_size` and that means new nodes will give it a default value of 0 and
 * ignore it for messages that miss this field.
 *
 * Once SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT cluster feature becomes supported by
 * the whole cluster, new nodes will start to set `page_size` to the right value
 * according to the interpretation described in the point (2).
 *
 * For each request, only the coordinator looks at
 * SEPARATE_PAGE_SIZE_AND_SAFETY_LIMIT and based on it decides for this request
 * whether it will be handled with interpretation (1) or (2). Then all the
 * replicas can check the decision based only on the message they receive.
 * If page_size is set to 0 or not set at all then the request will be handled
 * using the interpretation (1). Otherwise, interpretation (2) will be used.
